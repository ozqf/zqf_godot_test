# Godot Engine notes

These are notes regarding doing basic boilerplate stuff with the Godot Engine.

## GDScript - Language elements

### Absent features

These are common language features not present in gdscript (no comment on whether this is a good or bad thing):
* ++ or --
* switch
* private (everything is public)
* static variables. const instead of var is supported though eg
```
const DEG2RAD = 0.017453292519
const RAD2DEG = 57.2958
```
functions CAN be static however. Presumably all data must be passed in via arguments however?

### Useful extra keywords

* $ can be used as shorthand for get_node
eg ```get_node("NodePath").foo``` becomes ```$NodePath.foo```
* PI, TAU, INF (infinity), NAN
* Base types null, bool, int, float, String. Take that javascript. A proper int type.

### ToString
str(variable)
eg
```var txt = "Count is: " + str(count)```


### Globals

Globals are handled via an Auto load singleton.
Once a global script is setup in Project Settings -> Autoload you can use its name to access it
eg if you create a 'globals' auto load script, you can do this:
```var degrees = radians * globals.RAD2DEG```
